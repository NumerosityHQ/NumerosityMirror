## Development - Alpha Stage
The current codebase is messy, half implemented, and **will** break. We strongly advise you to **not** use the application or implement it in your program yet. Feel free to tinker with the existing project and contribute though!

## Codebase
We are working under a tight timeframe and we hope to build and clean up once we get to the alpha release.

## Launch
This application is under active development and aims to launch in Q3 2025 (Alpha release).

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome -- please create a PR and our moderators will take a look at it.
