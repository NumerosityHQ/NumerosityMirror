## Development
The current codebase is messy, half implemented, and **will** break. We strongly advise you to **not** use the application or implement it in your program yet. Please wait till the alpha release where we aim to have a basic implementation of features and documentation to go along with it.

## Codebase
This is also not the most up-to-date codebase. There does exist an internal codebase and parts of it are simply dumped into the repository. We are working under a tight timeframe and we hope to build and clean up once we get to the alpha release.

## Launch
This application is under active development and aims to launch in Q3 2025.

## Contributions

We do welcome contributions but we would advise you to please wait till the alpha version since the codebase is undergoing drastic changes.
