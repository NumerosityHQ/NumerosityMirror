Create a template for a web app that does the following:
Read questions from a database of text files and display the question, have a space for multiple choice answer options that are described in the text file in the format (you can also consider what format works the best when trying to parse the information when it is in a .txt file):
If the holistic solution does not make any sense, try to find another solution and explain your soluition before you start working on the project.
```
Date: parse from QuestionDate.txt
Question: parse from SampleQuestion.txt
Answer: parse from SampleAnswer.txt
Options: parse from SampleOptions.txt -> formatted in latex, every new line is a new option
Type: Math -> parse from questionType.txt
````
The user must be able to select answers, and once done, ask them to verify that it is the answer they want to submit and then show whether their answer is correct or not. Do not show the correct answer.

In the database of questions, each will have a different date. Make sure the question corresponds to the day the site has been loaded by the user with the system clock / IP address.

The user must also be able to make an account with just an email and password, preferably username and password without the need to use the @email.com part with Google Firebase.

The data must be stored in google Firebase Firestone.

Other features:
Underneath the questions, there must be a page that shows the users' following stats:
1. Curiosity Streaks (number of days a question has been attempted)
2. Genius Streaks (number of days a question has been answered right)
3. Time per question solved per day with a graph that can be interacted with -> use the DataPoints.JSON file to just plot points to make the graph
4. The types of questions solved right (can be tagged from the text file where it says 'Type:'
5. A share button that quickly generates a photo of the stats 
6. A friends tab that let's users add friends, remove friends. Next to the friends tab, there should be a list of all the user's friends with their Curiosity Streaks and Genius Streaks

As of styling, the font must be roboto site wide and dark mode with white text by default. Make sure it scales well across desktop and mobile devices (responsive). The color palette is : 
Black background 
White text in Roboto font
Correct answer's box highlighted in light green if the user chose the right answer
Wrong answer's box highlighted in light red if the user chose the wrong answer

Database setup and ideas:
The questions should be all loaded through the database directory form the Bank folder, and should keep track of what questions have been answered by the user -- this can be stored in firebase so that when the daily questions is called, it will never be the same.
Correct and wrong answers must be stored in their own JSON file in the Database/Storage folder in the respective correct or wrong folder. Each answer must be in its own JSON file with elements such as time taken to solve the question, options marked out.

Question setup:
The question has its own folder -- the question itself, the answer, the explanation and the question type. All of this will be written in LATEX format and should be interpreted as text when displayed on the site since it allows to display symbols like integrals, etc.
