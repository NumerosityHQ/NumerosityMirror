Create a web application that does the following:
1. Display the question from a JSON file with the multiple choice answer options.
2. Check and validate the answer chosen
3. Store that information in Firebase Firestore -> for every correct answer, create a new JSON file for the user in Firestone that has information as seen in correct.json or incorrect.json in the Storage folder.

Question format:
The question format is as follows:
{
    "date":"first value",
    "type":"second value",
    "level":"somevalue",
    "question":"third value",
    "option_a":"fourth value",
    "option_b":"fifth value",
    "option_c":"sixth value",
    "option_d":"seventh value",
    "answer":"eight value",
    "explanation":"ninth value"
}
And an example could be as follows:
{
    "date":"02/17/2025",
    "type":"Hard",
    "level":"Precalculus",
    "question":"\( x + 1 = 5 \)",
    "option_a":"1",
    "option_b":"f2",
    "option_c":"3",
    "option_d":"4",
    "answer":"4",
    "explanation":"\( x = 5 - 1 \)
                   \( x = 4 \)"
}
If it is a hard question from Precalculus, then you must rerieve the question form the Precalculus folder and the hard folder.
4. Make sure to keep track of what questions have been answered already, and if they got it right or wrong -- this should have been done before in the third step -- but find a efficient way so that the same question is not given to them again if there are thousands of questions in the database.
5. Also consider the fact that the questions are formatted in LATEX and you must parse the information correctly -- this done so that symbols like the integral symbol can be typed out.
