Create a template for a web app that does the following:
Read questions from a database of text files and display the question, have a space for multiple choice answer options that are described in the text file in the format (you can also consider what format works the best when trying to parse the information when it is in a .txt file):

```
Date: 02/08/2025
Question: What is the sum of 1 and 1?
Answer: 2
Options: 1,2,3,4
Type: Math
````
The user must be able to select answers, and once done, ask them to verify that it is the answer they want to submit and then show whether their answer is correct or not. Do not show the correct answer.

In the database of questions, each will have a different date. Make sure the question corresponds to the day the site has been loaded by the user with the system clock / IP address.

The user must also be able to make an account with just an email and password, preferably username and password without the need to use the @email.com part with Google Firebase.

The data must be stored in google Firebase Firestone.
